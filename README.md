# Module 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
In module 1, we are given two datasets, chips sales and customer data. We are required to carry out exploratory data analysis and extract insights about purchasing behaviour in each of the customer segment.

Based on this two dataset we have to find out

 1)The purchasing behavior of the customers

 2)planning what brand to stock in what layout , involve quantity 

 3)find out the type of customers who purchase chips and their purchasing behavior within the region

# Module 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing
In module 2, we are told that there are 3 trial stores that have gone through a 3-month trial period with altered store layouts. We need to assess whether or not these changes in store layouts have resulted in positive outcomes in terms of chips sales and number of customers who have purchased chips. In order to do this, we have to first assign a control store to each of the trial stores. Once the control stores have been determined, we proceed to use statistical test like the t-test to evaluate the difference in total sales and number of customers between the control stores and the trial stores during the trial period and subsequently draw conclusion on the effectiveness of the trial.
